1. This projects create visualization in Tableau using data from SQL server.
2. Tableau file holds query used to create dataset on the basis of which visualizations are developed.
3. Four tables are created using SQL query, the reason there are 4 different texcel files instead of one is beacause then you need a way to connect all the sheets using a common column, which I did not include in the tables.
4. Visualizations created in tables using those 4 tables are: Text Tables, Bar Chart, Symbol Map and Lines Chart
5. Technologies used are Excel, SSMS, SQL Server and Tableau.
